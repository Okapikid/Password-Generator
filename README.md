# Password-Generator

## Password Generator
This project utilized HTML, CSS, and Javascript to generate a password based on user criteria<br>
Once a user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they must select a password length (8â€“128 characters) and are then presented options for the types of characters to be included: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.<br>
<br>
If an invalid length is selected, users are prompted to choose a valid password length<br>
<br>
If no character types are selected, the user is prompted to choose at least one character type.<br>
